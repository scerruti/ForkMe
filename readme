This project is intended for student use by Wintriss Technical Schools. It is a
simplified desktop interface for GitHub that permits students to easily clone
their repositories to the desktop.

Future versions will manage student repositories ensuring changes are pushed and
removing repositories when the student logs out. It is also intended that this
tool will be able to automatically load cloned repositories into IDEs.

It is envisioned that this tool will eventually allow students to easily fork and
clone school repositories for their own use.

Accounts are stored without passwords using the Java preference mechanism. To clear
preferences on Unix like systems, check ~/.java/.user_prefs. Avatar images are also
cached.
